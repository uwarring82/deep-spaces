# Welcome

This group operates using a simple but deliberate structure designed for situations where outcomes are uncertain, questions are open, and people depend on one another to make progress. The structure does not tell you _what_ to think or _what_ to conclude. It defines _how_ we work together when stakes, responsibility, and creativity coexist.

At its foundation is Safe Space: clear procedures, visible rules, accountability, and the assumption that errors can be corrected. On this basis, we may activate Communication Space, where discussion is organised to reduce bias from hierarchy and habit, and where disagreement is allowed without penalty. Within that, we may enter Exploration Space, where ideas can be tentative, incomplete, or speculative—provided they remain tethered to reason, evidence, or a path back to shared understanding.

When all three are active, we call this state Deep Space: a protected mode for serious, creative work.

Participation in these modes is explicit. Roles are visible. Authority is declared when exercised. Stopping an activity for safety or fairness reasons ends the mode, not the conversation.

This framework is not mandatory, moral, or universal. It is one possible grammar for working together under uncertainty. By participating here, you agree to make the structure visible, to use it in good faith, and to help maintain the conditions that allow others to think, speak, and explore safely.

_Welcome._
