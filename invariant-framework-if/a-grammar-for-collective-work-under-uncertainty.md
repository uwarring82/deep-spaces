### Endorsement Marker

> **Local candidate framework (no parity implied with externally validated structures).**
>
> This framework describes a voluntary form for collective work under uncertainty. It does not claim universal applicability or endorsement parity with established procedural justice, metrological, or governance standards.
>
> External coastlines referenced but not replicated:
>
> * Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)
> * Local applicable law
> * Domain-specific safety regulations
> * Institutional governance structures
>
> This framework operates as a **Tier 2 coordination protocol** that references Tier 0 causal structures (accountability, traceability) and Tier 1b metrological discipline (falsifiability, evidence). It does not constitute a Tier 0 constitutional boundary and does not require JCGM or equivalent validation.

***

### Preamble

This framework defines structural conditions under which a group may choose to conduct collective work that is procedurally fair, discursively honest, and creatively disciplined.

It does not prescribe content. It does not bind roles. It does not mandate adoption.

#### Scope Guard

> This framework defines conditions under which a group **may choose** to operate. It does not mandate that all groups must operate this way.
>
> **Other grammars for collective work may be equally valid.**
>
> Adoption is voluntary. The framework describes a form, not a requirement. Claiming adoption does not confer moral superiority over groups that organise differently.

#### Negative Invariant (Protective Boundary)

> **NI-1: No instance of this framework may define criteria, procedures, or consequences that violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or applicable local law.**
>
> Where framework invariants conflict with legal requirements or fundamental rights, legal requirements and fundamental rights take precedence. The framework is subordinate to, not competitive with, established protective structures.

***

### Part I: Three Spaces

The framework defines three spaces. Each space provides distinct protections. The spaces are nested: outer spaces enable inner spaces.

| Space                   | What it provides                                       | Activation                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Safe Space**          | Procedural fairness, accountability, correctable error | Always active when framework is adopted |
| **Communication Space** | Bias-reduced discourse, symmetric participation        | Activatable within Safe Space           |
| **Exploration Space**   | Tethered inquiry, bounded speculation                  | Activatable within Communication Space  |

#### Nesting Constraint

```
Safe Space (always active under this framework)
    │
    └──► Communication Space (defined and valid only within Safe Space)
              │
              └──► Exploration Space (defined and valid only within Communication Space)
```

* Communication Space is not defined without Safe Space.
* Exploration Space is not defined without Communication Space.
* If Safe Space protections fail, all inner spaces collapse automatically.

This nesting is a **validity constraint**, not a containment metaphor. The inner spaces do not "exist inside" the outer spaces; they are **only permitted** when outer space protections are active.

***

### Part II: Deep Space

**Deep Space** is the state where all three spaces are simultaneously active:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\text{Deep Space} = \text{Safe Space} \wedge \text{Communication Space} \wedge \text{Exploration Space}</span></p>

This conjunction is implemented as nesting. Deep Space is not a fourth space; it names the condition of **maximal protection**.

Deep Space is where disciplined creative work becomes possible: inquiry that is tethered, discussed under bias-reduced norms, and protected by procedural fairness.

#### What Deep Space Is Not

| Misconception                | Correction                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A place                      | It is a state — the conjunction of three active spaces                  |
| Permanent                    | It exists only while all three spaces are active                        |
| Automatic                    | It requires explicit activation of Communication and Exploration Spaces |
| Unstructured                 | It inherits all structure from its constituent spaces                   |
| Superior to other approaches | It is one valid grammar among others                                    |

### Part III: Safe Space Invariants

When this framework is adopted, the following hold **at all times**. These are **form invariants**: they constrain how decisions are made, not what decisions are made.

<table><thead><tr><th width="89.55078125">ID</th><th width="200.28125">Invariant</th><th>Statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>SS-1</strong></td><td>Known Criteria</td><td>Consequences apply only to criteria known beforehand. Retroactive standards are invalid.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SS-2</strong></td><td>Proportional Authority</td><td>Responsibility attaches only to what could reasonably be influenced. Blame for the uncontrollable is invalid.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SS-3</strong></td><td>Traceable Decisions</td><td>Every consequential decision has a named decider and a stated reason. Anonymous or unexplained authority is invalid.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SS-4</strong></td><td>Separation of Layers</td><td>Purpose, procedure, and authority are kept distinct. Conflating them to obscure accountability is invalid.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SS-5</strong></td><td>Symmetric Visibility</td><td>Rules that apply to someone must be visible to them before they apply. Hidden rules are unenforceable.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SS-6</strong></td><td>Correctable Error</td><td>A single error does not terminate participation if acknowledged and a documented correction path is followed. What counts as "correctable" is defined by the instance; this invariant guarantees the path exists.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Safe Space Verification Invariant

<table><thead><tr><th width="90.265625">ID</th><th width="200.01953125">Invariant</th><th>Statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>SS-V</strong></td><td>Auditability</td><td>Each instance must document how SS-1 through SS-6 are verified: what evidence is collected, how often, and by whom. Claiming compliance without verification mechanism is invalid.</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

### Part IV: Communication Space Invariants

When Communication Space is active, the following hold **in addition to** Safe Space invariants. These govern bias-reduced discourse.

<table><thead><tr><th width="89.953125">ID</th><th width="199.96875">Invariant</th><th>Statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>CS-1</strong></td><td>Participant-Led Default</td><td>Those with less structural power lead discourse by default. "Led" refers to agenda-setting and articulation priority, not to decision authority unless explicitly specified by the instance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CS-2</strong></td><td>Scaffolded Authority</td><td>Those with more structural power observe by default. Intervention requires an explicit trigger defined by the instance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CS-3</strong></td><td>Explicit Invocation</td><td>Authority interventions must be declared before exercised. Undeclared intervention is out of order.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CS-4</strong></td><td>Symmetric Load</td><td>The burden of making oneself understood falls equally on all participants. Structural power does not exempt from explanation.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CS-5</strong></td><td>Divergence Without Defeat</td><td>Lack of consensus is recorded, not forced. No participant "loses" a Communication Space session. Divergence is a valid outcome.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CS-6</strong></td><td>Retractable Commitment</td><td>Positions stated during Communication Space may be withdrawn without penalty unless explicitly marked as "committed."</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CS-7</strong></td><td>Logged Interventions</td><td>Authority interventions are recorded with timestamp, trigger cited, and brief reason.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CS-P</strong></td><td>Power Ambiguity Default</td><td>When structural power relations are ambiguous, contested, or context-dependent, default to the most protective interpretation: treat all parties as having less structural power until explicit agreement establishes otherwise.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Communication Space Verification Invariant

<table><thead><tr><th width="88.703125">ID</th><th width="199.8828125">Invariant</th><th>Statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>CS-V</strong></td><td>Intervention Audit</td><td>Intervention logs must be reviewable by participants and periodically reviewed by someone outside the immediate discourse chain. Systematic deviation from declared triggers must be escalatable.</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

### Part V: Exploration Space Invariants

When Exploration Space is active, the following hold **in addition to** Communication Space invariants. These govern tethered inquiry.

<table><thead><tr><th width="90.27734375">ID</th><th width="199.54296875">Invariant</th><th>Statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>ES-1</strong></td><td>Tethered Speculation</td><td>Claims must connect to at least one tether: <strong>falsifiability</strong> (what would show it wrong), <strong>coherence</strong> (logical consistency), or <strong>causal traceability</strong> (connection to mechanism or evidence pathway). Claims without any tether are marked "untethered" — permitted but not citable as established.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ES-2</strong></td><td>Declared Scope</td><td>Each exploration session states its bounds. Out-of-scope claims are out of order for that session.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ES-3</strong></td><td>Reversible Commitment</td><td>Exploration produces candidates, not conclusions. Promotion from candidate to conclusion requires return to Communication Space and deliberation.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ES-4</strong></td><td>Return Path</td><td>Exploration maintains connection to Communication Space. Findings must be reportable. Inquiry that cannot be communicated is outside the envelope.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ES-5</strong></td><td>Nonsense Boundary</td><td>Content that cannot in principle connect to any tether (no falsification possible, no logical structure, no causal pathway) is marked "outside envelope." This is navigation, not punishment.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ES-6</strong></td><td>Boundary Logging</td><td>Tethering status (tethered / untethered / outside envelope) is recorded for all substantive claims.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Exploration Space Verification Invariant

<table><thead><tr><th width="90.484375">ID</th><th width="199.99609375">Invariant</th><th>Statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>ES-V</strong></td><td>Tethering Audit</td><td>Boundary logs must be reviewable and periodically checked by someone outside the exploration chain. Systematic failure to mark untethered claims must be escalatable.</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

### Part VI: Meta-Rules

These rules apply across all spaces. They are elevated to invariant status because they govern the framework's own operation.

#### Transition Rules

<table><thead><tr><th width="89.52734375">ID</th><th width="200.19140625">Rule</th><th>Statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>M-1</strong></td><td>Stops End Modes, Not Conversations</td><td>Invoking Safe Space to halt activity closes Communication and Exploration Spaces but requires: (1) recording the reason in the session log, and (2) scheduling a follow-up in Communication Space within 5 working days or at the next scheduled session, whichever is sooner. Safe Space may stop actions but may not terminate deliberation without documentation and a planned return path.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>M-2</strong></td><td>Authority Must Be Explicit</td><td>No one exercises authority without declaring they are doing so. Undeclared authority is out of order.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>M-3</strong></td><td>Commitments Must Be Markable</td><td>Statements are exploratory unless explicitly marked as committed. The default is uncommitted.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Accountability Rules

<table><thead><tr><th width="89.96484375">ID</th><th width="200.5390625">Rule</th><th>Statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>M-4</strong></td><td>Accountability Is Complete</td><td>Every role is accountable to some other role or body. No role is exempt. The instance must specify the complete accountability chain.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>M-5</strong></td><td>Escalation Exists</td><td>For every role, there is a path to a higher authority if local resolution fails. The instance must specify escalation paths.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>M-6</strong></td><td>Visibility Is Symmetric</td><td>What applies to someone must be visible to them before it applies. This restates SS-5 at the meta level for emphasis.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Temporal Rules

<table><thead><tr><th width="88.94921875">ID</th><th width="199.86328125">Rule</th><th>Statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>M-T</strong></td><td>Return Horizon</td><td>Every Exploration Space session must specify a return horizon: when findings will be reported to Communication Space (e.g., "by session end," "within 48 hours," "at next scheduled meeting"). Open-ended exploration without return commitment is invalid.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>M-A</strong></td><td>Abandonment Escalation</td><td>If an exploration exceeds its return horizon without report, the matter automatically escalates to Safe Space review. Abandoned explorations are logged and closed. This prevents indefinite deferral.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Boundary Violation Protocol

<table><thead><tr><th width="89.9609375">ID</th><th width="199.7578125">Rule</th><th>Statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>M-B</strong></td><td>Violation Handling</td><td>When an invariant is violated: (1) the violation is logged with description and affected parties, (2) the matter escalates per M-5, (3) remediation is documented, (4) pattern violations trigger review of instance design. Single violations are correctable per SS-6; systematic violations indicate instance failure.</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

### Part VII: What This Framework Does Not Specify

This framework is deliberately silent on:

<table><thead><tr><th width="339.4296875">Domain</th><th>Reason</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Who the participants are</td><td>Instance-specific</td></tr><tr><td>What roles exist</td><td>Instance-specific</td></tr><tr><td>What activities occur</td><td>Instance-specific</td></tr><tr><td>What consequences attach to what</td><td>Instance-specific</td></tr><tr><td>What counts as "correctable" (SS-6)</td><td>Instance-specific</td></tr><tr><td>What triggers permit intervention (CS-2)</td><td>Instance-specific</td></tr><tr><td>What tether types are primary (ES-1)</td><td>Instance-specific</td></tr><tr><td>How often sessions occur</td><td>Configuration</td></tr><tr><td>Who currently holds which role</td><td>Configuration</td></tr></tbody></table>

These belong to **Instance Frameworks** and **Initialisation Parameters**, not to this invariant layer.

***

### Part VIII: Instance Template

To adopt this framework, a group must produce an **Instance Framework** that binds abstract structures to concrete context.

#### A. Context Declaration

| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Participant with less structural power               | Role name(s)                        |
| Participant with more structural power (scaffolding) | Role name(s)                        |
| Accountable authority                                | Role name                           |
| External escalation body                             | Body name                           |

#### D. Communication Space Binding

| How is CS-V (intervention audit) implemented? | Review mechanism                       |

#### E. Exploration Space Binding

| Question                                       | Instance must specify                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| What tether types are primary in this context? | Selection from falsifiability / coherence / causal |
| What counts as "scope" for exploration?        | Definition for this context                        |
| How are candidates promoted to conclusions?    | Deliberation path                                  |
| What is the default return horizon (M-T)?      | Time specification                                 |
| How is ES-V (tethering audit) implemented?     | Review mechanism                                   |

#### F. Handbook Scope

| Question                                         | Instance must specify        |

| What logging is required?                        | Specified per space          |
| What consequences attach to handbook violations? | Specified per role           |

***

### Part IX: Initialisation Parameters

Separate from the Instance Framework, each operating period requires **Initialisation Parameters**:

| Parameter type       | Examples                                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Role bindings        | "Tutor = Alice, Bob; Organiser = Carol" |
| Contact points       | Email addresses, office locations       |
| Dates and deadlines  | Semester dates, submission deadlines    |
| Emergency contacts   | Safety officer, institutional contacts  |
| Escalation endpoints | Current dean, current ombudsperson      |

**Critical constraint:**

> Changing parameters must never require reinterpretation of invariants.
>
> If a parameter change would alter the meaning of an invariant, it is not a parameter change — it is an instance change and must be documented as such.

***

#### Cascade Rule

Closing Communication Space automatically closes Exploration Space. The reverse is not true: closing Exploration Space returns to Communication Mode.

#### Emergency Return

Any participant may invoke "Safe Space" at any time. This:

1. Immediately closes Exploration and Communication Spaces
2. Returns to Baseline
3. Requires logging the reason (per M-1)
4. Requires scheduling follow-up (per M-1)
