### B. Safe Space Binding

#### B.1 Procedural Fairness Definition

In this instance, **procedural fairness** means:

1. **Transparent expectations**: All criteria for contribution, authorship, and assessment are stated before work begins
2. **Consistent application**: Same standards apply to all participants for equivalent work
3. **Reasoned decisions**: Every consequential decision (authorship, project direction, resource allocation) includes stated reasoning
4. **Appeal pathway**: Every decision can be questioned through defined channels
5. **No retroactive standards**: Criteria announced after completion cannot affect evaluation

#### B.2 Accountability Chain

```
Team Members → Project Leads → Principal Investigator → Dean / Ombudsperson
                                        │

**Escalation deadlines:**

* Acknowledgement: 2 working days
* Resolution: 10 working days
* If longer needed: notify parties with new deadline

#### B.4 Consequences by Role

| Role              | Consequence type           | Examples                                                            | Speed         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Team members**  | Project consequences       | Reduced responsibility, additional mentorship, project reassignment | Days to weeks |
| **Project leads** | Role consequences          | Documented discussion, mentorship review, role adjustment           | Weeks         |
| **PI**            | Institutional consequences | Dean review, formal intervention                                    | Months        |

#### B.5 SS-6 "Correctable Error" Definition

In this instance, an error is **correctable** if:

1. The person acknowledges the error
2. A documented correction path exists (GitLab issue, revised analysis, rewritten section)
3. The person follows the correction path
4. The error is not a scientific integrity violation (which follows DFG / institutional process)

**Specific correctable errors:**

* Calculation mistake: correction + documentation of original error
* Missed deadline (first instance): rescheduled commitment + documented reason
* Inadequate documentation: revision with feedback
* Minor safety protocol deviation (first instance): retraining + continuation

**Non-correctable within this instance:**

* Data fabrication or falsification: DFG / institutional process
* Plagiarism: DFG / institutional process
* Repeated serious safety violations: exclusion from hazardous work
* Persistent failure to meet commitments after documented support: project removal

#### B.6 SS-V Auditability Implementation

### C. Role Bindings

| Abstract Role (Framework)              | Concrete Role (This Instance)   | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Participant                            | **Team member**                 | PhD students, postdocs, researchers contributing to projects |
| Participant with scaffolding authority | **Project lead**                | Senior postdoc or scientist coordinating a specific project  |
| Accountable authority                  | **Principal Investigator (PI)** | Prof. Schaetz or designated deputy                           |

| Session coordinator                    | **Facilitator**                 | Rotating role for Communication/Exploration sessions         |

#### Role Characteristics

| Role             | Structural power source                       | Constraints on power                                                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Team member**  | Academic freedom; expertise; labour           | Subject to project structure; time-limited contracts                        |
| **Project lead** | Expertise; project coordination; mentorship   | Accountable to PI; must follow protocols; no final resource authority alone |
| **PI**           | Institutional position; funding; group design | Accountable to Dean; bound by regulations; must respond to escalations      |
| **Facilitator**  | Session coordination (temporary)              | Manages process only; no content authority; rotates                         |

#### Facilitator Designation

* **Default:** Most senior postdoc present, unless otherwise specified
* **Rotation:** No individual may serve as Facilitator for more than three consecutive sessions
* **Declaration:** Facilitator is named in session announcement (Mattermost or calendar invite)

***

### D. Communication Space Binding

#### D.1 When Communication Space Activates

Communication Space is explicitly activated for:

* Sprint planning and retrospectives
* Manuscript review sessions
* Experimental design discussions
* Data interpretation meetings
* Any session where bias-reduced deliberation is valuable

**Activation:** Facilitator declares: "Communication Space active" (logged in Mattermost or session notes).

#### D.2 Intervention Triggers

Project leads and senior scientists observe by default in Communication Space. Intervention is permitted only under these triggers:

| Trigger     | Code | Description                                                        | Examples                                                       |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Safety**  | T1   | Physical safety risk is emerging                                   | Incorrect procedure, equipment hazard                          |
| **Factual** | T2   | Clear factual error with high confidence that would block progress | Fundamental physics misconception, numerical error in analysis |
| **Process** | T3   | Feedback on how discussion is conducted, not its content           | Unequal participation, time drift, unclear communication       |

**Trigger constraints:**

* T1 immediately invokes Safe Space protocols; no justification delay
* T2 requires >90% confidence that error would block progress; if uncertain, note for later
* T3 addresses process only; may not redirect scientific content under T3

#### D.3 Divergence Recording Format

When Communication Space ends in divergence:

```
DIVERGENCE RECORD
=================
Session: [Date, Topic, Participants]
Topic: [What was discussed]

POSITIONS
---------
Position A: [One sentence]
Position B: [One sentence]
[Position C, etc. if applicable]

RESOLUTION STATUS
-----------------
[ ] Divergent — no consensus reached
[ ] Partially resolved — consensus on [aspect], divergence on [aspect]

FOLLOW-UP
---------
[ ] None required
[ ] Communication Space session scheduled for [date]
[ ] To be revisited in [context]
```

Positions are attributed to "Position A," "Position B," etc., not to named individuals unless all parties consent.

#### D.4 CS-V Intervention Audit Implementation

| Audit element        | Mechanism                          | Frequency    | Reviewer  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Intervention logging | Mandatory field in session log     | Each session | Automatic |
| Trigger compliance   | Sample review of intervention logs | Quarterly    | PI        |
| Pattern detection    | Aggregate analysis by person       | Annual       | PI        |

***

### E. Exploration Space Binding

#### E.1 The Interdisciplinary Triad

OneWorld commits to the following structural principle:

> **Triad Norm:** Each substantive research question should engage at least two of three modalities:
>
> * **Theoretical analysis** (analytical models, derivations, formal arguments)
> * **Experimental investigation** (laboratory measurements, data collection)
> * **Numerical simulation** (computational models, Monte Carlo, optimisation)
>
> Sprint planning explicitly allocates effort across modalities. Single-modality work requires logged justification.

#### E.2 Primary Tether Types

In research context, the following tethers apply:

| Tether                    | Application                  | Examples                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Falsifiability**        | Primary for empirical claims | "If measured value differs from prediction by >3σ, hypothesis is falsified"       |
| **Coherence**             | Supporting                   | "This interpretation is consistent with conservation laws and established theory" |
| **Causal traceability**   | Supporting                   | "This effect could be caused by X, which we can test by Y"                        |
| **Methodological rigour** | Supporting                   | "This analysis follows GUM uncertainty propagation"                               |

**Tether hierarchy:** Falsifiability is primary for empirical claims. Coherence and causal traceability support but do not substitute for falsifiability where measurement is possible.

#### E.3 Scope Declaration Format

```
EXPLORATION SCOPE
=================
Topic: [What is being explored]
Domain: [Physics area / project context]
Modalities engaged: [ ] Theory  [ ] Experiment  [ ] Numerics
In bounds: [Specific hypotheses, methods, analyses permitted]
Out of bounds: [What is explicitly excluded]
Tether types: Falsifiability (primary), [others]
Return horizon: [Time specification — default 5 working days]
```

#### E.4 Default Return Horizon

| Exploration context        | Default return horizon                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Within-session exploration | End of session                                          |
| Between-session analysis   | Next scheduled session or 48 hours, whichever is sooner |
| Manuscript exploration     | Agreed deadline                                         |
| Extended investigation     | Explicitly agreed; maximum 2 weeks                      |

**M-A enforcement:** If return horizon passes without report:

1. Facilitator notes abandonment in session log
2. Matter flagged for next Communication Space session
3. If pattern emerges (2+ abandonments), PI review

#### E.5 ES-V Tethering Audit Implementation

| Audit element        | Mechanism                                         | Frequency        | Reviewer     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Boundary logging     | Exploration log template                          | Each exploration | Facilitator  |
| Tethering compliance | Sample review of logs                             | Quarterly        | Project lead |
| Promotion validity   | Check conclusions trace to deliberated candidates | Each manuscript  | Co-authors   |

## Part II: Unified Essay

### Why OneWorld Exists

This is a place where we do science together.

We are experimentalists, theorists, and computational scientists working on problems at the frontier of quantum and atomic physics. Our experiments push trapped-ion systems into new regimes. Our theory connects what we measure to what we understand. Our numerics bridge the gap between idealized models and messy reality.

None of this happens alone. The best work emerges when different perspectives meet—when an experimentalist's intuition about noise combines with a theorist's insight about symmetry and a computational scientist's ability to simulate what neither can calculate by hand.

But collaboration under uncertainty is hard. We are uncertain about our data, uncertain about our interpretations, uncertain about which paths will lead somewhere. This uncertainty is not a flaw; it is the nature of research. The question is how to work together productively despite it.

OneWorld is a grammar for that work. Not a prescription for what to think, but a structure for how to think together.

***

### The Three Spaces

#### Safe Space: The Foundation

Research happens within structures—institutional, legal, professional. These structures exist to protect everyone.

You cannot be blamed for what you could not control. Every decision affecting you has a name attached and a reason stated. If you make a mistake, there is a path to correction. If you disagree with a decision, there is a path to appeal.

These are not aspirations. They are invariants. They hold because the structure enforces them.

Safe Space is always active. It is not something we enter; it is the ground we stand on.

#### Communication Space: Honest Discourse

Science advances through argument. But argument performed for status is not the same as argument pursued for understanding.

When hierarchy distorts discourse, junior researchers guess what senior scientists want to hear rather than articulate what they actually think. The result is a simulation of collaboration, not collaboration itself.

Communication Space exists to make honest articulation safer. When Communication Space is active, participants lead. Observers intervene only when safety, clear factual error, or process failure requires it. When observers speak, they must say why.

This is not hierarchy abolished. It is hierarchy made visible and accountable.

The goal is not consensus for its own sake. Divergence is legitimate. The goal is that when consensus emerges, it reflects genuine understanding—not deference, not exhaustion, not social pressure.

#### Exploration Space: Disciplined Creativity

Research requires permission to be wrong. Hypotheses that cannot be tested are not yet science, but hypotheses that are never proposed cannot become science either.

Exploration Space exists because creativity requires freedom—but not freedom from discipline. The boundary between speculation and nonsense is falsifiability: if you can say what would show you wrong, you are exploring; if you cannot, you are drifting.

We do not punish drift. We mark it. The mark says: this is outside the envelope for now. Perhaps a tether will be found. Perhaps not. Either way, navigation remains clear.

Exploration Space produces candidates, not conclusions. Conclusions require deliberation in Communication Space.

#### Deep Space: Where Creative Work Lives

Deep Space is the state where all three spaces are active simultaneously: procedural protection, bias-reduced discourse, and tethered inquiry.

This is where the most valuable work happens—not because it is comfortable, but because it is safe enough to be genuinely difficult.

***

### The Interdisciplinary Triad

Quantum physics at the frontier requires multiple modes of understanding.

**Theory** provides the formal structure—the equations, the symmetries, the limits of what is possible. Without theory, we collect data without meaning.

**Experiment** provides the empirical anchor—the numbers that nature gives us, whether we like them or not. Without experiment, our theories are untested stories.

**Numerics** provides the bridge—the simulations that connect idealized theory to realistic conditions, the optimizations that find parameters theory cannot predict, the visualizations that reveal patterns data alone hides.

No single modality is sufficient. The best work engages at least two, and often all three.

OneWorld treats the Triad as a structural commitment. When we plan work, we ask: which modalities does this engage? When we review progress, we ask: have we checked theory against experiment, experiment against simulation, simulation against analytical limits?

This is not bureaucracy. It is discipline in service of depth.

***

### What We Commit To

#### What the PI Commits To

I create and maintain the conditions for serious work.

* I publish expectations before they apply
* I ensure project leads are supported
* I respond to escalations within stated deadlines
* I admit when something is my fault
* I do not change standards retroactively

#### What Project Leads Commit To

We coordinate projects and mentor team members. We do not do their work for them. We do not leave them alone with it.

In Communication Space:

* We listen before we speak
* We declare our triggers when we intervene
* We ask clarifying questions before correcting
* We accept that our expertise is a resource, not a conclusion

In Exploration Space:

* We hold the tether, not the direction
* We ask "what would falsify this?" rather than "this is wrong"
* We protect the return path so no one gets lost

We remember that we once stood where junior researchers stand now.

#### What Team Members Commit To

We engage with the work seriously—not because we are told to, but because serious engagement is how science advances.

In Communication Space:

* We say when we do not understand, even when it feels exposing
* We articulate our actual reasoning, not the reasoning we think is expected
* We accept that divergence is legitimate

In Exploration Space:

* We propose ideas even when uncertain
* We state what would falsify our proposals, or acknowledge we cannot yet
* We accept boundary markings as navigation, not judgment

In documentation:

* We record what we do, when we do it
* We meet deadlines or communicate in advance
* We contribute to shared resources

***

### Welcome

You are joining a team dedicated to understanding nature at its most fundamental level.

The work is hard. The problems are unsolved. The path forward is uncertain.

That is why the structure matters. Not to constrain creativity, but to protect it. Not to enforce conformity, but to enable honest disagreement.

We look forward to what we will discover together.

#### 1.2 GitLab: The Central Repository

**What it is:** GitLab is a version control system. It tracks every change to code, data, and documentation, creating a complete history of who changed what, when, and why.

**Why we use it:**

* **Traceability (SS-3):** Every commit has a named author and a commit message explaining the change
* **Reproducibility:** Any previous state can be restored
* **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work
* **Auditability:** The history cannot be silently altered

**What goes in GitLab:**

* Analysis code and scripts
* Processed data (raw data may be too large; link to storage location)
* Documentation and lab notebooks (digital)
* Project management (issues, milestones, merge requests)
* Meeting notes and decision logs

**Getting started:**

1. Create an account at gitlab.uni-freiburg.de using your university credentials
2. Request access to the group repositories from your project lead
3. Complete the GitLab tutorial (linked in Appendix A)
4. Clone your first repository and make a test commit

**Best practices:**

* **Clear commit messages:** Describe what changed and why, not just "updated file"
* **Use branches:** Create a branch for new features or analyses; merge when complete
* **Frequent commits:** Commit often with small changes rather than rarely with large changes
* **Pull before push:** Always pull the latest changes before starting work

#### 1.3 Mattermost: Real-Time Communication

**What it is:** Mattermost is a team messaging platform, similar to Slack. It provides channels for different topics, direct messages, and integrations with other tools.

**Why we use it:**

* **Accessibility:** Quick questions and updates without email overhead
* **Transparency:** Conversations in channels are visible to relevant team members
* **Integration:** Links to GitLab, calendar, and other tools
* **Logging:** Conversations are searchable and archived

**Channel structure:**

| Channel              | Purpose                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **#general**         | Announcements, group-wide information            |
| **#random**          | Non-work conversation, social                    |
| **#\[project-name]** | Project-specific discussion                      |
| **#safety**          | Safety alerts, protocol updates                  |
| **#papers**          | Literature sharing, paper discussions            |
| **#deep-space-logs** | Session logs for Communication/Exploration Space |

**Best practices:**

* Use threads for extended discussions
* Use @mentions sparingly (only when someone's attention is needed)
* Move detailed technical discussions to GitLab issues if they need tracking
* Respond to direct messages within one working day

#### 1.4 Overleaf: Collaborative Writing

**What it is:** Overleaf is a web-based LaTeX editor that allows multiple people to edit documents simultaneously.

**Why we use it:**

* **Real-time collaboration:** See changes as they happen
* **Version history:** Track who wrote what
* **LaTeX support:** Professional typesetting for physics manuscripts
* **GitLab sync:** Documents can be synced to GitLab for backup and version control

**Workflow:**

1. Create project in Overleaf or clone from GitLab template
2. Invite collaborators using their email addresses
3. Work in rich-text or source mode as preferred
4. Use comments for questions and suggestions
5. Sync to GitLab at major milestones

**Authorship tracking:**

* Overleaf history shows who wrote each section
* Supplement with CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) for formal authorship records
* Discuss authorship early and revisit as contributions evolve

#### 1.5 Literature Management: Zotero / Mendeley

**What it is:** Reference managers that store, organize, and cite scientific literature.

**Why we use them:**

* **Organization:** Keep papers organized by project, topic, or tag
* **Citation:** Generate bibliography entries automatically
* **Sharing:** Shared libraries for group-relevant papers
* **Access:** Browser extensions to save papers with one click

**Workflow:**

1. Install Zotero or Mendeley and browser extension
2. Join the group shared library (link from project lead)
3. Save relevant papers as you read
4. Add notes and tags for future reference
5. Use citation integration with Overleaf

**VPN access:**

To access journals from off-campus, set up VPN:

1. Follow university VPN setup instructions (linked in Appendix A)
2. Connect to VPN before accessing journal websites
3. Papers will be available as if on campus

```

#### 2.2 Agile Framework for Research

We adapt Agile methodologies for research coordination:

**Sprint:** A 2-4 week period focused on specific goals

**Sprint planning:** At sprint start, set goals and tasks

* What will we accomplish this sprint?
* What are the blockers?
* How does effort distribute across the Triad?

**Daily standups:** Brief (15 min) daily or every-other-day check-ins

* What did I do since last standup?
* What will I do before next standup?
* What is blocking me?

**Sprint review:** At sprint end, demonstrate work

* What did we accomplish?
* What did we learn?
* What should we show others?

**Sprint retrospective:** At sprint end, discuss process

* What went well?
* What could improve?
* What will we change next sprint?

#### 2.3 Documentation Standards

### Chapter 5: Safety Protocols

#### 5.1 Training Requirement

**Rule:** Everyone entering laboratory spaces must hold valid safety training.

| Requirement                                           | Deadline                | Consequence of failure         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| General laboratory safety                             | Before first entry      | No laboratory access           |
| Electrical safety                                     | Before first entry      | No laboratory access           |
| Experiment-specific modules (laser, cryogenics, etc.) | Before that experiment  | No access to that experiment   |
| Renewal                                               | Per module requirements | Access suspended until renewed |

#### 5.2 Three Safety Rules

These always apply:

1. **Know before you touch.** If you do not understand equipment, ask before using it.
2. **Report problems immediately.** If something breaks, sparks, leaks, or behaves unexpectedly, tell someone at once.
3. **Never work alone with hazardous equipment.** Check experiment documentation for when a second person is required.

**Consequence of violation:**

* First violation: Immediate removal from session; retraining; documented
* Repeated violation: Exclusion from hazardous work

#### 5.3 Emergency Return ("Safe Space" Invocation)

Any participant may invoke "Safe Space" at any time to halt activity. This:

1. Immediately stops all Communication Space and Exploration Space activities
2. Activates standard safety protocols if physical safety is involved
3. Requires logging the reason (M-1)
4. Requires scheduling follow-up within 5 working days

No justification is required at the moment of invocation. The reason is logged afterward.

***

### Chapter 6: Scientific Integrity

#### 6.1 Guiding Documents

We adhere to:

* **DFG White Paper:** "Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice"
* **University Regulations:** University of Freiburg's Academic Integrity policies
* **Physics Recommendations:** From the Konferenz der Fachbereiche Physik

#### 6.2 Core Principles

* **Honesty:** Report what was measured, not what was expected
* **Transparency:** Document methods completely so others can reproduce
* **Fairness:** Credit contributions accurately
* **Responsibility:** Take accountability for your work

#### 6.3 Data Management

* Raw data is never modified; corrections are applied in separate processing steps
* All analysis code is version-controlled
* Data processing is documented sufficiently for reproduction
* Data retention follows funder and institutional requirements
