### B. Safe Space Binding

#### B.1 Procedural Fairness Definition

In this instance, **procedural fairness** means:

1. **Assessment transparency**: All grading criteria are published before work begins
2. **Consistent application**: Same criteria apply to all students for the same experiment
3. **Reasoned decisions**: Every grade includes written justification
4. **Appeal pathway**: Every decision can be questioned through defined channels
5. **No retroactive standards**: Criteria announced after submission cannot affect grades

#### B.2 Accountability Chain

**Escalation deadlines:**

* Acknowledgement: 2 working days
* Resolution: 10 working days
* If longer needed: notify parties with new deadline

#### B.4 Consequences by Role

| Role           | Consequence type           | Examples                                                                 | Speed                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Students**   | Grade consequences         | Mark reduction, resubmission required, experiment repeat, course failure | Immediate to end of semester |
| **Tutors**     | Role consequences          | Documented note, formal discussion, removal from tutoring role           | Slower (weeks)               |
| **Organisers** | Institutional consequences | Dean review, formal intervention                                         | Slowest (months)             |

#### B.5 SS-6 "Correctable Error" Definition

In this instance, an error is **correctable** if:

1. The student acknowledges the error
2. A documented correction path exists (resubmission, repeat, remediation)
3. The student follows the correction path
4. The error is not an academic integrity violation (which follows separate institutional process)

**Specific correctable errors:**

* Late submission (first instance): grade penalty + acceptance
* Failed entrance procedure: reschedule and repeat (up to 2 failures)
* Inadequate report: resubmission opportunity with feedback
* Safety protocol minor violation (first instance): retraining + continuation

**Non-correctable within this course:**

* Academic integrity violation (plagiarism, data fabrication): institutional process
* More than 2 failed entrance procedures: course failure
* More than 1 report graded 5.0: course failure
* Repeated serious safety violations: course exclusion

### D. Communication Space Binding

#### D.1 Intervention Triggers

Tutors observe by default in Communication Space. Tutors may intervene only under these triggers:

| Trigger     | Code | Description                                                        | Examples                                                                         |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Safety**  | T1   | Physical safety risk is emerging                                   | Incorrect equipment handling, chemical hazard, electrical risk                   |
| **Factual** | T2   | Clear factual error with high confidence that would block learning | Fundamental physics misconception, equation error that would invalidate analysis |
| **Process** | T3   | Feedback on how discussion is conducted, not its content           | Unequal participation, time management, unclear communication                    |

**Trigger constraints:**

* T1 immediately invokes Safe Space protocols; no justification delay
* T2 requires tutor confidence >90% that error would block learning; if uncertain, wait for feedback phase
* T3 addresses process only; tutor may not redirect scientific content under T3

#### D.2 Feedback Phase Structure

| Phase                         | Timing                                        | Purpose                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Immediate oral feedback**   | End of Communication Space session            | Brief summary of observations            |
| **Delayed written feedback**  | Within 14 calendar days of report submission  | Detailed assessment with grade           |
| **Clarification opportunity** | On request, within 7 days of feedback receipt | Student may ask questions about feedback |

#### D.3 Divergence Recording Format

When Communication Space ends in divergence:

```
DIVERGENCE RECORD
Session: [Date, Experiment, Participants]
Topic: [What was discussed]
Position A: [One-sentence summary]
Position B: [One-sentence summary]
[Position C, etc. if applicable]
Resolution status: Divergent — no consensus reached
Follow-up: [Scheduled Communication Space session OR "None required"]
```

Positions are attributed to "Position A," "Position B," etc., not to named individuals unless all parties consent.

#### D.4 CS-V Intervention Audit Implementation

| Audit element        | Mechanism                                                      | Frequency    | Reviewer                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Intervention logging | Mandatory field in session log                                 | Each session | Automatic                      |
| Trigger compliance   | Sample review of intervention logs                             | Monthly      | Organiser                      |
| Pattern detection    | Aggregate analysis of interventions by tutor                   | Semester end | Organiser                      |
| Student feedback     | Anonymous end-of-course survey includes intervention questions | Semester end | Organiser + Dean (if patterns) |

**Escalation for systematic deviation:**

* 3+ undeclared interventions in one semester → formal discussion with organiser
* Pattern across multiple students → tutor retraining or role reassignment

### E. Exploration Space Binding

#### E.1 Primary Tether Types

In Master Laboratory context, the following tethers apply:

| Tether                  | Application | Examples                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Falsifiability**      | Primary     | "If measured value differs from theoretical prediction by >3σ, hypothesis is falsified" |
| **Coherence**           | Supporting  | "This interpretation is consistent with conservation laws"                              |
| **Causal traceability** | Supporting  | "This effect could be caused by thermal drift, which we can test by..."                 |

**Tether hierarchy:** Falsifiability is primary for experimental claims. Coherence and causal traceability support but do not substitute for falsifiability where measurement is possible.

#### E.2 Scope Definition

In this instance, **exploration scope** means:

| Scope element     | Definition                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain**        | The physics of the specific experiment being conducted                                                                                  |
| **In bounds**     | Hypotheses testable with available equipment; methods achievable in session time; analysis within student capability with scaffolding   |
| **Out of bounds** | Claims requiring equipment not available; methods requiring expertise beyond M.Sc. level; speculation unconnected to current experiment |

**Scope declaration format:**

```
EXPLORATION SCOPE
Experiment: [Name]
Domain: [Physics area]
In bounds: [Specific hypotheses, methods, analyses permitted]
Out of bounds: [What is explicitly excluded]
Tether types: Falsifiability (primary), [others if applicable]
Return horizon: [Time specification]
```

#### E.3 Candidate Promotion Path

```

**Promotion requirements:**

1. Return to Communication Space (may keep Exploration Space active or close it)
2. Present candidate with explicit tether criterion
3. All participants may question or challenge
4. If consensus: candidate becomes conclusion (entered in report as finding)
5. If divergence: candidate remains candidate (may be noted in report as "explored but unresolved")

#### E.4 Default Return Horizon

| Exploration context           | Default return horizon                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Within-session exploration    | End of lab session                                      |
| Between-session analysis      | Next scheduled session or 48 hours, whichever is sooner |
| Report-writing exploration    | Report submission deadline                              |
| Extended investigation (rare) | Must be explicitly agreed with tutor; maximum 1 week    |

**M-A enforcement:** If return horizon passes without report:

1. Tutor notes abandonment in session log
2. Matter flagged for next Communication Space session
3. If pattern emerges (2+ abandonments), organiser review

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Boundary logging      | Exploration log template (mandatory)                   | Each exploration session | Automatic         |
| Tethering compliance  | Sample review of exploration logs                      | Monthly                  | Tutor peer review |
| "Untethered" tracking | Count of untethered claims per student                 | Semester end             | Organiser         |
| Promotion validity    | Check that conclusions trace to deliberated candidates | Each report              | Tutor (grading)   |

## Part II: Unified Essay

### Why This Laboratory Exists

This is a place where we do physics together at the advanced level.

You have completed introductory laboratories. You have learned to follow protocols, record data, and calculate uncertainties. Now something different is asked of you.

In the Master Laboratory, you are not executing prescribed procedures. You are engaging with experiments as a scientist would: understanding the physics deeply enough to make choices, recognizing when something unexpected happens, and reasoning through problems that do not have pre-written solutions.

This requires trust. Trust that your questions will be taken seriously. Trust that your mistakes will be opportunities for learning, not occasions for humiliation. Trust that the system is fair.

We have built this laboratory to earn that trust through structure, not promises.

***

### The Three Spaces

#### Safe Space: The Foundation

The laboratory operates within a procedural framework that protects everyone.

You cannot be assessed on criteria you did not know. You cannot be blamed for what you could not control. Every decision affecting you has a name attached and a reason stated. If you make a mistake, there is a path to correction.

These are not aspirations. They are invariants. They hold because the structure enforces them.

Safe Space is always active. It is not something we enter; it is the ground we stand on.

#### Communication Space: Honest Discourse

Physics is learned through struggle, but struggle performed is not struggle shared.

When status distorts discourse, students guess what tutors want rather than articulate what they think. The result is a simulation of learning, not learning itself.

Communication Space exists to make honest articulation safer. In Communication Space, students lead. Tutors observe by default and intervene only when safety, clear factual error, or process failure requires it. When tutors speak, they must say why.

This is not hierarchy abolished. It is hierarchy made visible and accountable.

The goal is not consensus for its own sake. The goal is that when consensus emerges, it reflects genuine understanding, not deference.

#### Exploration Space: Disciplined Creativity

Some questions about your experiment have no established answer. Some methods have not been tried. Some connections have not been drawn.

Exploration Space exists because creativity requires permission to be wrong—but not permission to be untethered. The boundary between speculation and nonsense is falsifiability: if you can say what would show you wrong, you are exploring; if you cannot, you are drifting.

We do not punish drift. We mark it. The mark says: this is outside the envelope for now. Perhaps a tether will be found. Perhaps not. Either way, navigation remains clear.

Exploration Space produces candidates, not conclusions. Conclusions require deliberation.

#### Deep Space: Where Creative Work Lives

Deep Space is the state where all three spaces are active simultaneously: procedural protection, bias-reduced discourse, and tethered inquiry.

This is where the most valuable work happens—not because it is comfortable, but because it is safe enough to be genuinely difficult.

### What We Commit To

#### What Organisers Commit To

We create and maintain the conditions for serious work.

* We publish all criteria before they apply
* We ensure tutors are prepared and supported
* We respond to escalations within stated deadlines
* We admit when something is our fault
* We do not change rules retroactively

#### What Tutors Commit To

We accompany students through both learning and assessment. We do not do the work for them. We do not leave them alone with it.

In Communication Space:

* We listen before we speak
* We declare our triggers when we intervene
* We ask clarifying questions before correcting
* We accept that our expertise is a resource, not a conclusion

In Exploration Space:

* We hold the tether, not the direction
* We ask "what would falsify this?" rather than "this is wrong"
* We protect the return path so no one gets lost

We remember that we once stood where students stand now.

#### What Students Commit To

We engage with the work seriously—not because we are told to, but because serious engagement is the only way this becomes valuable.

In Communication Space:

* We say when we do not understand, even when it feels exposing
* We articulate our actual reasoning, not the reasoning we think is expected
* We accept that divergence is legitimate

In Exploration Space:

* We propose ideas even when uncertain
* We state what would falsify our proposals, or acknowledge we cannot yet
* We accept boundary markings as navigation, not judgment

In assessment:

* We produce reports that reflect our genuine understanding
* We meet deadlines or communicate in advance
* We engage with feedback, even when difficult

### Chapter 2: Safety (Tier 0 — Always Active)

#### 2.1 Training Requirement

**Rule:** Everyone entering the laboratory must hold valid safety training.

| Requirement                                                | Deadline               | Consequence of failure         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| General laboratory safety                                  | Before first entry     | No laboratory access           |
| Electrical safety                                          | Before first entry     | No laboratory access           |
| Experiment-specific modules (laser, radiation, cryogenics) | Before that experiment | No access to that experiment   |
| Renewal                                                    | Every 12 months        | Access suspended until renewed |

#### 2.2 Three Safety Rules

These always apply:

1. **Know before you touch.** If you do not understand equipment, ask before using it.
2. **Report problems immediately.** If something breaks, sparks, leaks, or behaves unexpectedly, tell someone at once.
3. **Never work alone with hazardous equipment.** Check the experiment guide for when a second person is required.

**Consequence of violation:**

* First violation: Immediate removal from session; retraining; documented
* Repeated violation: Course exclusion

#### 2.3 Emergency Return

Any participant may invoke "Safe Space" at any time to halt activity. This:

1. Immediately stops all Communication Space and Exploration Space activities
2. Activates standard safety protocols
3. Requires logging the reason
4. Requires scheduling follow-up within 5 working days

***

### Chapter 3: Student Procedures

#### 3.1 Before Each Experiment

| Action                            | Purpose                   | Tier   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------ |
| Complete safety training          | Required for entry        | Tier 0 |
| Read experiment guide             | Preparation for learning  | Tier 0 |
| Prepare for entrance conversation | Effective use of lab time | Tier 0 |

#### 3.2 Entrance Conversation (Tier 0/1 Boundary)

The entrance conversation is a 15-minute discussion with your tutor before measurements begin.

**What you should be able to discuss:**

* What you are measuring and why it matters
* How the technique works (concept, not buttons)
* What you expect and what would surprise you
* Main sources of uncertainty

**This is part of the learning phase — not graded.**

| Outcome      | Meaning                                                        | Consequence                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Passed**   | Understanding demonstrated                                     | Proceed to measurements                  |
| **Repeated** | Gaps identified; tutor taught; understanding then demonstrated | Proceed; documented; no grade impact     |
| **Failed**   | Understanding not achieved; sent home to prepare               | Reschedule required; counts toward limit |

**Hard limit:** More than 2 failed entrance conversations across all experiments → course failure.

#### 3.3 During Lab Sessions (Tier 0 + Optional Tier 1/2)

**Always (Tier 0):**

* Record equipment identifiers, settings, timestamps
* Note anomalies immediately
* Stop and ask if uncertain about next action

**In Communication Space (Tier 1):**

* Lead discussion of physics and method
* Expect tutors to observe by default
* If tutor intervenes, they will state their trigger

**In Exploration Space (Tier 2):**

* Declare scope before beginning
* State tethers for claims
* Maintain return path
* Accept boundary markings

#### 3.4 Assessment Deliverables

| Deliverable       | Deadline                                                | Format                                    |

| Review this instance document           | Before first session  | Documented; retraining                   |

#### 4.2 Session Facilitation

**Default mode (Tier 0):**

* Be present and prepared
* Monitor safety
* Available for questions

**Communication Space (Tier 1):**

* Observe by default
* Intervene only under T1/T2/T3 triggers
* Declare trigger before speaking
* Log all interventions

**Exploration Space (Tier 2):**

* Facilitate tethering checks
* Mark boundaries without judgment
* Protect return path
* Do not provide conclusions; ask "what would falsify this?"

#### 4.3 Intervention Protocol

1. Signal intention (raise hand or agreed gesture)
2. State: "Intervening under \[T1/T2/T3]: \[brief reason]"
3. Make intervention (maximum 2 minutes unless T1)
4. Log intervention before session ends

**If uncertain whether to intervene:**

* Default: do not intervene; note for feedback phase
* Exception: T1 (safety) — intervene immediately, justify later

#### 4.4 Feedback Deadlines

#### 4.5 Grading

**Process:**

1. Assess written report against published criteria
2. Factor in oral presentation
3. Consult with organiser if grade is unusual or uncertain
4. Provide written feedback explaining grade
5. Enter grade and feedback in ILIAS

**Constraints:**

### Chapter 9: Scientific Integrity

#### 9.1 Core Principles

* **Do not fabricate data.** Record what you observe, not what you expect.
* **Do not falsify data.** Do not alter, omit, or misrepresent results.
* **Do not plagiarise.** Acknowledge all sources. Use your own words.
* **Document everything.** Your notebook must allow verification.

#### 9.2 Institutional Framework

The University of Freiburg's regulations on safeguarding academic integrity apply. Violations are serious and can result in course failure or further consequences.

**Resources:**

* University of Freiburg: Academic Integrity — https://uni-freiburg.de/research/academic-integrity/
* Institute of Physics: Scientific Honesty — https://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/redlichkeit-en
